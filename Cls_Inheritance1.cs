         * Inheritance : It is carrying forward the properties or traits of a class to another class
         * Code reuseability is the key focus during inheritance 
         * Using Inheritance one or more classes can be derived from an existing class
         * The existing class is called parent/base class and the inherited class is derived/inherited class
         * Types of inheritance 
         * 1. single 
         * 2. hierarchical
         * 3. Multi-level
         * 4. Multiple(using Interface)
